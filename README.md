# From RAG to Agents: Building Smart AI Assistants

In this workshop we

- Build a RAG application on the FAQ database
- Make it agentic
- Learn about agentic search
- Use PydanticAI to make it easier
- Give tools to our agents

# Environment

For this workshop, all you need is Python with Jupyter.
I use GitHub Codespaces to run it (see [here](https://www.loom.com/share/80c17fbadc9442d3a4829af56514a194))
but you can use whatever environment you like.
